# About

## Professional

Entrepreneur at heart, I use what I have learned from owning two businesses
over 25 years to have an impact and bring value to small business in my market.
I have a passion for developing people and relationships, but most importantly
for understanding companies and their business plans to help them grow and be
successful.

## Personal

I love people. Everything I do is to build people up and watch them grow.
