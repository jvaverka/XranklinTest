<a id="fnref_free"></a>
, as in costs no money. Or things can be
free, as in speech, as in do whatever you want just leave me out of it. Linux
is the shining example of both.</p>
<h3 id="gnu_/_linux" ><a href="#gnu_/_linux"> GNU / Linux</a></h3><p>Linux (or GNU/Linux) is a free and open-source operating system that I started
using around 2018. Actually, my first encounter was in 2016, but I was a mere
philistine who couldn't comprehend its relevance. Not coincidentally,
re-introduction corresponded with my joining a high-powered development team.
Embracing Linux (and open-source software in general) revealed a new perspective
on what was possible on computers.</p>
<p>However, there is some good news and some bad news. Such is life.</p>
<h3 id="bad_news" ><a href="#bad_news"> Bad News</a></h3><p>There is an old adage:</p>
<blockquote><p>Linux is only free if your time has no value.<sup><a href="#fn_linux">[2]</a></sup>
<a id="fnref_linux"></a>
</p>
</blockquote><p>I.e., prepare yourself for a time-sink.</p>
<p>I believe most Linux users would concede this point.<sup><a href="#fn_but">[3]</a></sup>
<a id="fnref_but"></a>
 The learning curve
is real, it can be steep, and only the committed among us survive the journey
to reap the reward.</p>
<p>While we're at it, let's gripe a bit:</p>
<p>üçá Terminals are scary (at first)<sup><a href="#fn_term">[4]</a></sup>
<a id="fnref_term"></a>
</p>
<p>üçá Hardware support not guaranteed &#42;cough&#42; GPUs & Bluetooth</p>
<p>üçá Foot-guns are a thing</p>
<p>What's a <em>foot-gun</em> you ask. Let me demonstrate.</p>
<h4 id="dependency_hell" ><a href="#dependency_hell"> Dependency Hell</a></h4><img src="./world-of-pain.jpg" alt="world-of-pain"><p>Ever heard of <a href="https://harfbuzz.github.io/"><code>harfbuzz</code></a>? Me neither until I
thought ligatures were a real terminal necessity. Don't know what ligatures
are? Maybe your better off not knowing.<sup><a href="#fn_jk">[5]</a></sup>
<a id="fnref_jk"></a>
 Gross over simplification -
<code>harfbuzz</code> is a library needed for ligatures. No problem - there's a build
section in the library docs, and after my first <code>meson build</code> I have my
ligatures!</p>
<p>I'm pretty pleased until some time later upon realizing that several other
programs depend on this library and are now failing. One solution proposed on
Arch Wiki was to set the <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> environment variable to help each program
find its preferred library. Kind of a hack-y band aid, but it got me unstuck and
working again. "Flipping" this additional switch was fine until I ran across
programs that failed no matter which way the switch was flipped. Finally, I was
forced to confront the real problem.</p>
<p>The solution - do another <code>meson build</code> with an additional flag that was needed
for my particular system and which was not well documented. This was painful.
When you're navigating uncharted waters, it's unclear where the danger will be
lurking. However, that does <em>NOT</em> mean that you should be scared to explore.
This bout frustrated me at times, but I learned about <code>harfbuzz</code> and why
programs like <code>Libre Office</code> and <code>Pandoc</code> rely on it.</p>
<p>Anyone who gets started with Linux will find their own unique <em></em>Harfbuzz Hell<em></em>
because each user will customize their machine to their liking for their
functions. So best advise is embrace it and look for the learning opportunities.
They are plentiful.</p>
<h3 id="good_news" ><a href="#good_news"> Good News</a></h3><p>Congratulations for making it to the good news (we're almost done here). In
keeping with the theme, here is another obscure quote.</p>
<blockquote><p>To live only for some future goal is shallow. It's the sides of the mountain
which sustain life, not the top. Here's where things grow.<sup><a href="#fn_zen">[6]</a></sup>
<a id="fnref_zen"></a>
</p>
</blockquote><p>Diving into the unknown and keeping an open mind will reveal many treasures
among the growing pains. There is a lot to explore. So many brilliant people
have worked hard on open-source projects and selflessly shared the end product.
There's really no <em>need</em> to pay for an operating system or any software if you
don't want to. A little exploration will prove this, and those things which
seemed scary will turn out to be over-sized teddy bears.</p>
<p>There's too many to count, but here are some things I appreciate:</p>
<ul>
<li>üíô Terminals ‚áí beautifully simple command line tools<sup><a href="#fn_cli">[7]</a></sup>
<a id="fnref_cli"></a>
</li>
<li>üíô Open-source ‚áí constant innovations</li>
<li>üíô Shell ‚áí script automate everything</li>
<li>üíô Options ‚áí for those who want better</li>
<li>üíô Freedom (as in speech) ‚áí customize everything<sup><a href="#fn_de">[8]</a></sup>
<a id="fnref_de"></a>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="perfect_fit" ><a href="#perfect_fit"> Perfect Fit</a></h4><p>Every person has different need, use-case, aesthetic, etc. It follows that
every person has a different <em>perfect</em> computer setup. Just like how the world
is not black and white, not everyone can be fully described in one of two
buckets.<sup><a href="#fn_os">[9]</a></sup>
<a id="fnref_os"></a>
</p>
<p>There is a richness in diversity in Linux. Users have a choice of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution">distribution</a> suited for
particular purposes and tastes (maybe too many choices so just pick
<a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> to start then
<a href="https://embeddedinventor.com/distro-hopping-what-why-how-explained/">hop</a> to
your desire). Users have a choice of <a href="https://itsfoss.com/what-is-desktop-environment/">desktop
environment</a> that will help
them fine tune the look and feel that works best for them. Finally, users have
full control of their systems. Users can do <em>anything</em> and are only limited by
the time they choose invest.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion" ><a href="#conclusion"> Conclusion</a></h2><img src="./opinion.jpg" alt="opinion"><p>Good software exists. Some of it's free-as-in-beer, some of it's
free-as-in-speech. There's many cases of both throughout Linux and the wider
Open-source community. Best part - it's for everybody!</p>
<p>Remember, you are not alone. There is a strong community of Linux
enthusiasts in the world who are willing and able to help you get started.
Anyone can do this and there is nothing to lose.</p>
<p>Linux (and Open-source software in general) is a bountiful garden. Dig it.</p>
<p>Share this with a curious soul or anyone asking about Linux.</p>
